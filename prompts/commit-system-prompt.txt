Generate a concise, one-line Git commit message summarizing the diff of staged files.
Don't add tags or category (feat, fix, etc.) in the beginning of the message.
Keep it professional and informative.

Think carefully before you write your commit message.

What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"
